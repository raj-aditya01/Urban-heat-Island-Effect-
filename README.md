# Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect Mitigation Using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze and predict Urban Heat Island (UHI) hotspots using machine learning techniques and recommend effective mitigation strategies such as green roofs, reflective materials, and urban greening. The goal is to assist urban planners and environmental engineers in designing sustainable, climate-resilient cities.

## ðŸŒ† Problem Statement

Urban areas tend to experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to human activities, dense infrastructure, and lack of greenery â€” a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This project uses satellite imagery and environmental datasets to:
- Identify UHI hotspots
- Predict temperature patterns
- Recommend mitigation strategies

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Satellite image and geospatial data preprocessing
- UHI hotspot detection using clustering and regression models
- Visualization of heat maps and temperature trends
- Strategy recommender system for mitigation planning

- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Geopandas
- OpenCV
